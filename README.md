# Gopilot

In this project, I have created my own copilot by using Google's Gemini API in my notebook, which can chat, code and can do many more. These are the four features that I have implemented:-

**Simple Chat Feature**

**Chat with Code Feature**

**Generate Code Feature**

**Generate Relational Code Feature**

We can also extend it to many more features like getting insights, visualizations, access files etc.
